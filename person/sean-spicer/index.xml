          No one from the White House. That was a DOJ decision.

              Trump later admitted he decided to fire Comey first, then sought justification from DoJ.

<p>The report’s authors said it shows that voter rolls are “susceptible to fraud,” though they did not claim it was evidence of actual fraud. (Indeed, the Guardian reported that senior White House adviser Stephen Bannon was registered in two states.) Rather, Pew said that it is evidence of the need to upgrade voter registration systems.</p>

              Official aerial photos show Obama&rsquo;s 2009 inauguration was much more heavily attended.

                <blockquote><p><a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-inauguration-ratings-20170119-story.html">According to preliminary data from Nielsen</a>, 30.6 million viewers across 12 networks watched Trump’s inauguration. Two inaugurations beat Trump’s TV viewership: Obama in 2009 (37.8 million) and Ronald Reagan in 1981 (41.8 million).</p>

<p>Spicer noted that CNN.com drew <a href="http://ew.com/tv/2017/01/21/trump-inauguration-ratings/">16.9 million</a> livestreams. Combined with TV viewings, that would boost Trump to an audience of at least 47.5 million.</p>

<p>In 2009, however, CNN.com provided <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/TECH/01/21/inauguration.online.video/">nearly 27 million streams</a> for Obama’s inauguration, giving a viewership of at least 59.1 million. That’s still 17.3 million more than Trump’s.</p>

              <dd>
                <blockquote><p>This is an appalling performance by the new press secretary. He managed to make a series of false and misleading claims in service of a relatively minor issue. Presumably he was ordered to do this by Trump, who conjured up fantastic numbers in his own mind, but part of a flack’s job is to tell the boss when lies are necessary — and when they are not.</p>

<p>Spicer earns Four Pinocchios, but seriously, we wish we could give five.</p>
