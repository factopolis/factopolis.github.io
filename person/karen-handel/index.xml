          Because the United States has the highest corporate rates in the world, and we need to start to draw those down in order to be more competitive.

              <h5>The Truth:</h5>

              The US does have a high <em>statutory</em> rate (up to 35%), but significant deductions and exemptions mean companies actually end up paying a much lower rate; the <em>effective</em> tax rate is about average. Furthermore, while the statutory rate relatively high, it is not the highest in the world; that distinction goes to the United Arab Emirates with rates up to 55%.
