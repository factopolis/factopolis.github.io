          That piece of paper folks wanted me to sign, think of where it came from, it came from the Governors of New York and California, the two biggest polluting states in the country… Look, we are good environmental stewards here.

              <h5>The Truth:</h5>

                <blockquote><p>His press secretary tried to soften the claim, but no matter how you look at it, that’s not accurate. In terms of absolute carbon dioxide emissions, California and New York rank No. 2 and No. 9. Texas is No. 1.</p>

<p>Adjusting for population and GDP, California and New York are actually among the most effective states at reducing their impact on the atmosphere – beating even Sununu’s home state of New Hampshire.</p>
