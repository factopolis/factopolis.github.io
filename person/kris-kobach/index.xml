        <blockquote>
          Now, however, facts have come to light that indicate that a pivotal, close election was likely changed through voter fraud on November 8, 2016: New Hampshire&rsquo;s U.S. Senate Seat, and perhaps also New Hampshire&rsquo;s four electoral college votes in the presidential election.

              They don&rsquo;t; college students to this often, and it&rsquo;s completely legal.

                <blockquote>But that&rsquo;s no smoking gun. It is plausible, in fact likely, that most of those voters were college students who are allowed by state law to vote in New Hampshire even though they only live in the state part of the year.</blockquote>

                <blockquote>He cited 5,313 votes cast with out-of-state IDs, but New Hampshire law says there&rsquo;s nothing inherently fraudulent about them, as a person can lawfully vote in New Hampshire while holding motor vehicle registration or a driver&rsquo;s license in another state.</blockquote>

                <blockquote>Kobach says there were 5,313 fraudulent ballots cast by out-of-state voters in New Hampshire. That is not supported by facts. New Hampshire allows temporary residents with out-of-state IDs to vote in the state, as long as they primarily live in the state. It does not necessarily mean these voters committed fraud. The state is investigating 196 people who voted in another state but were on the New Hampshire voter list. Even if all 196 people were confirmed as fraudulent cases, it would not be enough to tip the outcome of either the Senate or the presidential race.</blockquote>
