        <blockquote>
          So I was very proud of the policies we put forth. You know, I kept waiting for the moment &ndash; I, you know, I&rsquo;ve watched a million presidential debates in my life and I was waiting for the moment when one of the people asking the questions would have said, well, so exactly how are you going to create more jobs, right? &hellip; I thought at some moment that would happen.

<p>Clinton also takes the &ldquo;let it go&rdquo; quote out of context and time. Trump made that comment in 2015, not 2008. And he was making the point that a number of actions could have saved the auto industry, one of which was &ldquo;let it go&rdquo; into bankruptcy.</p>

Yes, Clinton later acknowledged that she was mistaken, but it&rsquo;s hard to understand how she could err on something so significant as whether she did or didn&rsquo;t dodge sniper bullets. Quite simply, this kind of hyperbole deserves our harshest assessment. We rule Pants on Fire.</blockquote>
