              <dd>
                <blockquote>Kimmel&rsquo;s claim that 30 million fewer Americans will have insurance may be a high-end estimate. But already, in 2019, CBO calculations suggest at least 15 million fewer Americans would have insurance once the individual and employer mandates are repealed. Much of that decline might be by choice, but Cassidy insists the gap will be filled and then exceeded in 10 years. Unlike Cassidy, no prominent health-care analyst is willing to venture a guess on coverage levels – but the consensus is that his funding formula makes his claim all but impossible to achieve.</blockquote>

<p>James Capretta, a fellow with the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, told ABC News the absence of the individual mandate means Graham-Cassidy is &ldquo;highly, highly unlikely&rdquo; to cover more people than current law.</p>
