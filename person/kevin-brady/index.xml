              <h5>The Truth:</h5>

              The US does have a high <em>statutory</em> rate (up to 35%), but significant deductions and exemptions mean companies actually end up paying a much lower rate; the <em>effective</em> tax rate is about average. Furthermore, while the statutory rate is relatively high, it is not the highest in the developed world; that distinction goes to the United Arab Emirates with rates up to 55%.

        <blockquote>
          So we start by providing the lowest tax rates in modern history for American businesses of all sizes. No longer will we be sitting on the sidelines with the highest corporate tax rate in the world. Instead, we&rsquo;re proposing a corporate rate of 20%; a rate that gets us in the game in a major way.
