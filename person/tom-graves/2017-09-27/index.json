It also promotes economic growth & private-sector job creation by slashing the corporate tax rate – currently the highest in the developed world – and ensuring fair treatment for small businesses. Congress needs to get the final product to the president's desk as quickly as possible.","quotePlain":"Our #TaxReform framework turns the page on a complicated & broken tax system.
