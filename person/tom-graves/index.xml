          Our <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TaxReform?src=hash">#TaxReform</a> framework turns the page on a complicated &amp; broken tax system. It&rsquo;s simpler, flatter &amp; fairer than the current tax code. It will put more money in the pockets of hard-working Americans. It also promotes economic growth &amp; private-sector job creation by slashing the corporate tax rate – currently the highest in the developed world – and ensuring fair treatment for small businesses. Congress needs to get the final product to the president&rsquo;s desk as quickly as possible.

              <h5>The Truth:</h5>

              The US does have a high <em>statutory</em> rate (up to 35%), but significant deductions and exemptions mean companies actually end up paying a much lower rate; the <em>effective</em> tax rate is about average. Furthermore, while the statutory rate is relatively high, it is not the highest in the developed world; that distinction goes to the United Arab Emirates with rates up to 55%.
