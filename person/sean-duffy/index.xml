        <blockquote>
          The single-payer program was tried in Vermont, where Bernie Sanders is from. They had to scrap it, it was way too much money, they were going bankrupt.

                <blockquote>Vermont adopted legislation for single-payer in 2011. But by 2014, Vermont’s governor abandoned the plan, saying the tax increases it needed would have been too high. In short, single-payer in Vermont didn’t go bankrupt; it was never even funded or implemented.</blockquote>
