        <blockquote>
          Chris, most economists believe that over 70 percent of corporate taxes are paid for by the workers. And the fact that the Treasury Department, I think it was eight or 10 years ago, put out a piece otherwise. I don&rsquo;t believe in that. Our current economic team does not believe in that. There is lots of economic research.

          The President has no intention &ndash; the President has released plenty of information and I think has given more financial disclosure than anybody else.  I think the American population has plenty of information on this.
