                <blockquote><p>We found one example — when Trump said, &ldquo;If you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would you?&rdquo; — that clearly fits the criteria of promoting or encouraging violence.</p>

<p>This was not an isolated incident; we found at least seven other examples in which Trump offered public musings that showed a tolerance for, and sometimes even a favorable disposition toward, physical violence.</p>

                <blockquote><p>This is laughable.</p>

<p>Even if you don&rsquo;t believe Trump has technically incited violence (which he has been sued for), he clearly nodded toward violence at his campaign rallies. Sometimes it was veiled; other times it was unmistakable. Sometimes he was talking about self-defense, but it was clear he was advocating for a “form of violence.”</p>

        <blockquote>
          I think he’s heard from the rank and file of the FBI, but particularly someone who had done a thorough review and someone who has the respect and reputation that the deputy attorney general has, he took that seriously. He took the recommendation seriously. And he made a decision based on that.

              Trump later admitted he decided to fire Comey first, then sought justification from DoJ.
