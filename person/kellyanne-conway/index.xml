        <blockquote>
          I bet, there was very little coverage — I bet it&rsquo;s brand new information to people that President Obama had a six-month ban on the Iraqi refugee program after two Iraqis came here to this country, were radicalized — and they were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre. I mean, most people don&rsquo;t know that because it didn&rsquo;t get covered.

<p>In addition, while the two men were charged with serious crimes and were sentenced accordingly, it’s important to remember that everything that happened was part of a sting operation by the FBI. This means that the people of Bowling Green were not endangered at any point, and that the entire incident can be viewed as a law-enforcement success.</p>

              U.S. purchases of Mexican goods are more than an order of magnitude larger.

                <blockquote><p>A projected $27 billion influx of cash from the United States into Mexico is nothing to sneeze at, and this money makes a real difference in the lives of many Mexicans who have relatives living and working in the United States, whether legally or illegally.</p>

<p>However, contrary to what Conway said, remittances do not rank No. 1 on the U.S.-Mexico income flow list. Rather, U.S. purchases of Mexican goods &ndash; to say nothing of services &ndash; are more than 10 times the size of remittances. And remittances also trail foreign direct investment as a source of income in Mexico.</p>
