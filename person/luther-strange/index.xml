                <blockquote><p>Of the two pay raises at issue, Moore only needed to approve one. The notion that he needed to fight for these raises is undercut by the fact that nearly half of Alabama state government employees got raises that year.</p>

<p>In any event, experts we spoke to unanimously agreed the two pay raise recipients were not &ldquo;politicians.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To the extent that Alabama courts experienced a shutdown in 2002, it occurred months after at least one of the raises had been approved, and after Moore had publicly advocated for more funding for courts.</p>
