          In fact, when it comes to business tax, we are now dead last among developed nations. We pay the highest tax of any nation in the world. Our rate is the least competitive rate there is.

              <h5>The Truth:</h5>

              The US does have a high <em>statutory</em> rate (up to 35%), but significant deductions and exemptions mean companies actually end up paying a much lower rate; the <em>effective</em> tax rate is about average. Furthermore, while the statutory rate is relatively high, it is not the highest in the developed world; that distinction goes to the United Arab Emirates with rates up to 55%.

According to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, only about 5,500 estates in 2017 &ndash; out of nearly 3 million estates &ndash; would have to pay any taxes. About half of estates subject to the tax would pay an average tax of about 9 percent. That’s because for a married couple, about $11 million is exempt from taxation.</p>

<p>Only 80 &ndash; that’s right, 80 &ndash; taxable estates would be farms and small businesses.</p>

<p>Separate research by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center <a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/sites/default/files/briefing-book/briefing_book_-_chapter_4.pdf">puts the number even lower</a>. TPC estimates that only 50 farms and closely held businesses will pay any estate tax in 2017.</p>

Overall, the very rich are affected in particular.</blockquote>

              Since he hasn&rsquo;t released his taxes it&rsquo;s difficult to analyze this, but his leaked 2005 returns show he would definitely benefit from abolishing the AMT, and his heirs would benefit from abolishing the estate tax.

                <blockquote><p>Of course, he has not released his tax returns, so it is difficult to know for sure. But he is certainly subject to the AMT &ndash; and the one recent tax return that has been leaked, from 2005, shows that the AMT increased his tax bill from about $5.3 million to $36.5 million. So at least in that tax year, he potentially could have saved $31 million.</p>

<p>Eliminating the estate tax, meanwhile, is likely to benefit his heirs.</p>

But based on <a href="http://time.com/4517197/donald-trump-defends-leaked-tax-returns-pueblo/">tax returns which have become public</a> and what we know of his finances, there are at least three key ways he could benefit.</blockquote>

              <h5>The Truth:</h5>

              Since he hasn&rsquo;t released his taxes it&rsquo;s difficult to analyze this, but his leaked 2005 returns show he would definitely benefit from abolishing the AMT, and his heirs would benefit from abolishing the estate tax.

                <blockquote>Trump&rsquo;s refusal to release his tax returns makes it impossible to quantify exactly how much he would personally benefit from his policy proposals. But what is known about Trump&rsquo;s past patterns of taxation and his income and wealth holdings strongly suggest that at least three proposed changes &ndash; to the alternative minimum tax, to the tax on &ldquo;passthrough&rdquo; income, and to the estate tax &ndash; would benefit Trump or his family either immediately or down the road.</blockquote>
