{"quote":"So General Pershing, tough, tough guy, and he had the whole deal going. And they catch 50 terrorists (in the Philippines), and they were doing tremendous destruction. What happens is he lines them up to be shot. He lines them up, gets them — knows they're guilty, they admitted they're guilty — lines 50 people up to be shot, and as you know, swine, pig, all that, a big problem for the, big problem. He took two pigs, and he chopped them open. Took the bullets, said \"We're going to go and shoot these men.\"  Took the bullets, the 50 bullets, dropped them in the pigs, swished them around so there was blood all over those bullets, had his men ­— instructed his men to put the bullets into the rifles. They put the bullets into the rifles, and they shot 49 men. Now, we don't like this, but I'm just saying if we're going to win, we're going to win or let's not play the game and let's not be a country anymore […inaudible…].\n\nThey put the bullets in the rifles, and they shot 49 of the 50 men. Dead. Boom. So there is a pig-infested bullet in each one. They then dumped into a mass grave, and they dumped the pigs in with the bodies, and they took the final bullet, and they gave it to the one person that they decided not to shoot, and they said, \"Here, take this bullet, go back to your people, and explain what we just did.\" Okay. That's not the end, here's the end. Want to hear the end? He went back and he said what just happened. For 28 years there was no terrorism. 28 years.","quotePlain":"So General Pershing, tough, tough guy, and he had the whole deal going.
