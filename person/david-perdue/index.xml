        <blockquote>
          U.S. corporate tax rate = highest in world. Right now, American companies are better off doing business overseas. We&rsquo;ve got to change that.

              <h5>The Truth:</h5>

              The US does have a high <em>statutory</em> rate (up to 35%), but significant deductions and exemptions mean companies actually end up paying a much lower rate; the <em>effective</em> tax rate is about average. Furthermore, while the statutory rate relatively high, it is not the highest in the world; that distinction goes to the United Arab Emirates with rates up to 55%.

        <blockquote>
          In 1986, when we lowered our corporate tax rate we were the third lowest corporate tax rate in the world. Today, we&rsquo;re absolutely the highest. And we look at the rest of the world, they&rsquo;ve caught up. Today, we are by far the highest corporate tax rate in the world.
