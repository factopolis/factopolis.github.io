          When it comes to businesses, right now we have the highest tax rate in the world, which means businesses who earn overseas income leave the money there rather than having to pay twice.

              The US does have a high <em>statutory</em> rate (up to 35%), but significant deductions and exemptions mean companies actually end up paying a much lower rate; the <em>effective</em> tax rate is about average. Furthermore, while the statutory rate relatively high, it is not the highest in the world; that distinction goes to the United Arab Emirates with rates up to 55%.

                <blockquote><p>Besides a reduction in the top tax rate, the tax plan would eliminate the alternative minimum tax (AMT). That in theory should be a boon for the wealthy as well, although it increasingly has snared families in the upper middle class, especially if they live in high-tax states or have many children.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>Finally, the tax plan calls for eliminating the estate tax, although it is unclear on whether any tax would be required when someone dies. Currently, the estate tax is estimated to affect only about 5,500 estates out of nearly 3 million estates because as much as $11 million can be shielded from taxation.</p>
