{"markdown":"**WORK IN PROGRESS**: this document is still very much a work in progress.\n\n### Finding Videos\n\nMost statements on Factopolis come from spoken words, which generally means video these days. Good sources can be hard to find, but hopefully this document can help.\n\nFor video from a news network, the best option is usually [Archive.org's TV News Archive](https://archive.org/details/tv):\n\n* [CNN](https://archive.org/details/TV-CNNW?sort=-date)\n* [Fox News](https://archive.org/details/TV-FOXNEWSW?sort=-date)\n* [MSNBC](https://archive.org/details/TV-MSNBCW?sort=-date)\n* [BBC](https://archive.org/details/TV-BBCNEWS?sort=-date)\n* [Fox Business](https://archive.org/details/TV-FBC?sort=-date)\n* [Bloomberg](https://archive.org/details/TV-BLOOMBERG?sort=-date)\n* [ABC](https://archive.org/details/TV-WJLA?sort=-date)\n\nFor Fox News and Fox Business, [video.foxnews.com](http://video.foxnews.com/) can also be a good source, but be prepared for a bunch of annoying ads you can't skip. You also can't start videos at a specific time, so if you can find a source on Archive.org please do so (Fox videos make for a good second copy of the video, though).\n\n[C-SPAN](https://www.c-span.org/) has a video player which works over HTTPS, a very extensive archive, and typically have good transcripts. This is probably the best way to go for anything appearing on C-SPAN. They have very good coverage of things like debates and rallys. C-SPAN is also available on Archive.org ([C-SPAN](https://archive.org/details/TV-CSPAN), [C-SPAN2](https://archive.org/details/TV-CSPAN2), [C-SPAN3](https://archive.org/details/TV-CSPAN3)).\n\nOther networks' official videos don't work as well:\n\n* NBC, MSNBC, and ABC have embedded players which don't work over HTTPS (Factopolis is always served over HTTPS).\n* CNN removes their videos after a while so they can charge for access to their archive.\n\nFor statements coming from the White House, the [White House Video Gallery](https://www.whitehouse.gov/featured-videos) has lots of videos, which are also made available through [their YouTube account](https://www.youtube.com/user/whitehouse).\n\nExcercise caution when using YouTube sources; you should avoid using videos without a reputable organization behind them. Videos can be edited selectively (for example, compare [this YouTube video of Donald Trump's 2016-09-20 rally in Kenansville, NC](https://youtu.be/8ZADcyBDZSw?t=2396) with the [unedited video from C-SPAN](https://www.c-span.org/video/?415591-1&start=2384); they've edited out [something significant](/person/donald-trump/2016-09-20/)!).\n\nGood sources on YouTube include:\n\n* [The White House](https://www.youtube.com/user/whitehouse)\n* [ABC News](https://www.youtube.com/user/ABCNews)\n* [Associated Press](https://www.youtube.com/user/AssociatedPress)\n* [Business Insider](https://www.youtube.com/user/businessinsider)\n* [CBS News](https://www.youtube.com/user/CBSNewsOnline)\n* [Chicago Tribune](https://www.youtube.com/user/ChicagoTribune)\n* [CNBC](https://www.youtube.com/user/cnbc)\n* [CNN](https://www.youtube.com/user/CNN)\n* [Fortune](https://www.youtube.com/user/FortuneMagazineVideo)\n* [Fox News](https://www.youtube.com/user/FoxNewsChannel)\n* [Mediaite](https://www.youtube.com/user/Mediaite)\n* [MSNBC](https://www.youtube.com/user/msnbcleanforward)\n* [NBC News](https://www.youtube.com/user/NBCNews)\n* [The New York Times](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheNewYorkTimes)\n* [NPR](https://www.youtube.com/user/npr)\n* [Politico](https://www.youtube.com/user/thepolitico)\n* [The Hill](https://www.youtube.com/user/thehilldotcom)\n* [The Independent](https://www.youtube.com/user/theindependent)\n* [The Toronto Star](https://www.youtube.com/user/TorontoStar)\n* [USA Today](https://www.youtube.com/user/USATODAY)\n* [Vox](https://www.youtube.com/user/voxdotcom)\n* [Washington Post](https://www.youtube.com/user/WashingtonPost)\n\nIt's worth noting that networks often only post what they consider to be highlights, rather than complete interviews, so even if you see something on TV you may not be able to find it on the network's site; Archive.org, on the other hand, includes everything.\n\n### Finding Content in Sources\n\nVideo (and audio) sources must include the start time and duration of the quote, which can be a bit of a pain if you are just looking for a sentence or two in a two hour video. Luckily, you can usually use subtitles or transcripts to speed up the search.\n\n**NOTE**: subtitles, transcripts, and prepared remarks are often imperfect representations of what was actually said. When searching for quotes you'll probably have to look for a word or two at a time instead of the whole thing.\n\nArchive.org and C-SPAN have transcripts for most videos.\n\nFor YouTube, you can use http://downsub.com/ to download subtitles in SRT format, then open them up in a text editor.\n\nFor other sites, the best thing is generally to have a transcript open and use it as a guide. For White House videos, transcripts are generally posted pretty quickly for [Speeches & Remarks](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-and-remarks), [Statements & Releases](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-and-releases), and [Press Briefings](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings). Many news channels post transcripts within 48 hours or so. Other than that, your best bet may be seaching for the event on Google with the word \"transcript\" appended. If you are able to find a transcript, please include a link to it; they may be useful for others, too.\n\nSeveral networks try to make transcripts available online, though often with a delay of several days, and shows never show up. Most are buried in the web site for each show, but here are a few:\n\n* NBC News\n  * [Meet the Press](https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-transcripts-n51976)\n* Fox News transcripts are buried in the web site for each show. Here are a few:\n  * [Special Report with Bret Baier](http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/special-report-bret-baier/transcripts)\n* [MSNBC](http://www.msnbc.com/transcripts)\n* [ABC News](http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=769462)\n","id":"/docs/video-sources/"}
