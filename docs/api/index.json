{"markdown":"**WARNING**: The API isn't stable yet; use it at your own risk! If\nnothing else, it will change when\n[Hugo bug #3832](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/3832) is\nfixed.\n\nFactopolis is open-source, and you can access all of our data from\n[our GitHub repository](https://github.com/factopolis/factopolis).\n\nWhile the markdown data is convenient for editing, it's a bit of a pain\nto access programatically, which is why we also provide HTTP-accessible\nJSON files which are built from the markdown:\n\n * [/index.json](/index.json) — All data for the site combined into a\n   single file. **Warning**: this file may be quite large, you should\n   download it sparingly.\n * [/person/index.json](/person/index.json) — Provides a list of all\n   people in the database, plus some additional data about each\n   person.\n * `person/*/index.json` — Information about the person, including a\n   list of claims.  Example:\n   [/person/donald-trump/index.json](/person/donald-trump/index.json)\n * `/groups/*/index.json` — Information about a group, including a\n   membership list.  Example:\n   [/groups/democratic-party/index.json](/groups/democratic-party/index.json)\n * `/claims/*/index.json` — Information about a claim. Example:\n   [/claims/half-of-ms-13-deported/index.json](/claims/half-of-ms-13-deported/index.json)\n * [/checker/index.json](/checker/index.json) — List of all fact\n   checkers.\n * `/checker/*/index.json` — Information about the fact\n   checker. Example:\n   [/groups/democratic-party/index.json](/groups/democratic-party/index.json)\n\nWe're in the process of  filling out the JSON data to support our\nclient-side front-end, but if you don't want to wait feel free to\n[contact us](https://github.com/factopolis/factopolis/issues) about\nmaking the data you need available.\n\nIf you make something interesting with this data, please\n[let us know](https://gitter.im/factopolis/)!\n","name":"API","id":"/docs/api/"}
