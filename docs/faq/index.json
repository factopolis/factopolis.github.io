{"markdown":"#### What makes Factopolis different?\n\nQuite a bit, actually.\n\nFirst, we prefer not to do any fact checking ourselves and mostly just link to checks performed by [other organizations](/checker). Our focus isn't on the fact checking, but documenting occurrences of claims which have been documented as false or misleading.\n\nMost fact checking sites post walls of text detailing their analysis of a particular statement. Once these are posted they are rarely revised; if the claim is repeated later a new fact check may be written (likely linking to the old one), or it may be ignored since the claim has already been checked.\n\nFactopolis, on the other hand, is intended as a living database. As new statements are made, either by the same person who made the initial claim or someone else, that information is added to the entry in our database for that claim.\n\nThis approach has several interesting benefits, including:\n\n* It is much easier to explore a claim's history.\n* Since we don't have to have a detailed fact check for every statement of a claim, information can be added more easily and quickly, meaning it should be possible to build a much more comprehensive database.\n* Grouping multiple statements of the same claim together even when worded slightly differently inherently de-emphasizes the exact phrasing and forces us to instead focus on the core of a claim. Our hope is that this will make Factopolis less hospitable for weasel words and trickery.\n\nAdditionally, Factopolis is free; anyone can use the database to power their own applications and analysis. We even provide [an unrestricted API](/api) to make this as easy as possible. We don't know what people will build, but we're excited to find out!\n\nFactopolis is collaboratively edited; anyone is free to submit information to the database. As long as it meets our quality standards (*i.e.*, appropriate and reliably sourced) we would be [happy to include it](/contributing).\n\nFinally, due to our structure sources take a much more central role, and are more heavily emphasized. We often have multiple sources for statements (including video, audio, transcripts, *etc.*) which are easily accessible, making Factopolis extremely well-suited for research.\n\n#### What do I do when a source has been removed or is otherwise inaccessible?\n\nUnfortunately, media sites often remove old content so they can charge for access to it, and copies posted to YouTube are sometimes taken down over to copyright assertions.\n\nPlease [file an issue](https://github.com/factopolis/factopolis/issues) as soon as possible and we'll do our best to find an alternative source.\n\n#### What is the relationship between themes, claims, and statements?\n\nStatements are specific instances of a person making a claim (i.e., a\nsingle quote). Claims are what statements assert. Themes are collections\nof claims which form a broader narrative.\n\nFor example, let's consider the \"birther\" movement. The theme is that\nBarack Obama was not born in the United States (and therefore not\neligible to be President). There are several claims which contribute to\nthis theme, such as that Obama's grandmother said he was born in Kenya,\nor his birth certificate is a forgery, or his college transcript says\nhe is an Indonesian citizen. Each time one of those claims was made is\na statement.\n\nWhile all claims which make it onto Factopolis are currently, at least\nto some degree, false, no judgments are about themes. It's entirely\npossible to offer false evidence in support of something which is true.\n\n#### Who is eligible to be on Factopolis?\n\nAny political figure, at any level. Anyone from a local school board\nrepresentative's spokesperson to the President. Pundits are also fair\ngame.\n\nCelebrities are acceptable as long as the content is political in\nnature, but are not a high priority.\n\nNote that this isn't restricted to the United States, though Factopolis\nitself is currently English-only. If you're interested in helping\nlaunch a version of the site in another language, possibly focused on\nanother country, please contact us.\n\n#### Why doesn't Factopolis include _______'s claim that _______?\n\nAssuming such content would been our quality requirements, because you\nhaven't added it yet!\n\nFactopolis is created and maintained by volunteers who have a finite\namount of time. If you feel something is missing, we would *love* for\nyou to [help](/contributing) fill in the gaps.\n\n#### Is Factopolis a liberal/conservative effort to discredit _______?\n\nWe try very hard to examine issues for veracity as dispassionately as possible, discounting partisanship.\n\nIf you feel we have made a factual error we encourage you to contact us as soon as possible, but keep in mind that we don't generally do any fact checking ourselves. Our role is largely as an aggregator of fact checks done by [other organizations](/checker).\n\n#### The \"last modified\" date is confusing.\n\nThe the date shown at the bottom of each page is the last time we modified that page, but many pages pull in content from other pages, and that information is not taken into account when generating the last modified date.\n\nFor example, the date shown on a person's page is the last time we changed something in the data about that person, such as altering a social media link, the office(s) they have held, etc. Adding a new statement or modifying an existing statement does *not* alter this date; for that information you would need to browse to the statement's page.\n\nFactopolis' entire history is stored in a [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) repository, which is [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/factopolis/factopolis). If you know where to look you can see what the site looked like at any point in time, and determine exactly who changed what, but git is designed for programmers and can be a bit unfriendly for a layperson. If you're trying to do something specific and having trouble, please drop by [our chat room](https://gitter.im/factopolis/) and we'll be happy to help you.\n\n#### How can I contact you?\n\nWe have a very strong preference for transparency, so whenever possible we try to make sure all discourse takes place in a public forum:\n\n* [Issue tracker](https://github.com/factopolis/factopolis/issues) — our preferred medium.\n* [Chat](https://gitter.im/factopolis/) — for those who prefer real-time communication.\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/factopolisdb)\n\nIf you *really* need to communicate in private for some reason, you can e-mail [private@factopolis.com](mailto:private@factopolis.com). Please don't abuse this; if you don't have a good reason for needing privacy we're likely to just ask you to use a public forum and refuse to otherwise respond.\n","name":"Frequently Asked Questions","id":"/docs/faq/"}
