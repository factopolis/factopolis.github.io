{"markdown":"### Help Wanted!\n\nFactopolis is a community-driven project, and a fairly large\nundertaking, so we need all the help we can get.\n\nIf you're interested in helping us build Factopolis, please stop by\n[our chat room](https://gitter.im/factopolis/) so we can talk.\n\nWe are always looking for new ideas, so if you have an something you'd\nlike to work on we'd love to discuss it with you. If you aren't sure\nhow you could help, here are some ideas:\n\n#### Content Editors\n\nOne of the best ways to help Factopolis is to dive in and start editing content.  Not only is it difficult for us to keep up with the new lies politicians and pundits tell, but we would also like to add as much historical data as we can!\n\nThe first thing you need to do is find content; the archives of [PolitiFact](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/), [FactCheck.org](http://www.factcheck.org/the-factcheck-wire/), as well as [others](/checker) are loaded with great information to comb through. Another surprisingly good source is fact checks which are already in our database; they often contain links to other statements and/or fact checks which aren't in our database (yet!).\n\nInformation we need to know includes:\n\n* If the claim is already in our database (for a different statement), specify the claim.\n* The exact quote.\n* At least one source for the quote, preferably from a separate location from any fact checks. The more the better, and [video sources](/docs/video-sources).\n* Any fact checks of the statement. All *claims* must have at least one fact check, though if a statement is merely repeating a claim which has already been checked in the context of a different statement then additional fact check(s) aren't required (though they are greatly preferred).\n\nCurrently supported sources include:\n\n* Video (including YouTube, raw video files, and embedded players)\n* Audio\n* Twitter\n* Transcripts and prepared remarks\n* Web sites which don't fit into one of the above types, such as news articles.\n\n[Video and/or audio sources](/docs/video-sources) are generally preferable to text-only, though whenever possible both should be provided. To find text sources, adding \"transcript\" to a search for an event often produces favorable results.\n\nWe prefer longer videos as opposed to those which *only* show the statement in question, to make it easier for people to see the context of the statement.\n\nFor both audio and video, please include the start time and end time where the precise quote appears.\n\nFor both individual quotes and general claims, the more fact checks you can find the better!  As long as they come from credible sources, we love having multiple sources.\n\nOnce you have that information, you can [submit it to our issue\ntracker](https://github.com/factopolis/factopolis/issues/new) and\nwe'll try to add it to our database as soon as possible.\n\nIf you'd like to take it a bit further, you can add the claim to the\ndatabase yourself and submit a pull request.  We'll try to write\ndocumentation for this process soon, but the basic idea is that you\nneed to add a claim to the\n[content/claim](https://github.com/factopolis/factopolis/tree/master/content/claim)\ndirectory, and add an entry to the file of whover made the claim in\nthe\n[content/person](https://github.com/factopolis/factopolis/tree/master/content/person)\ndirectory.  Once that's done you can submit a pull request.\n\n#### Designers\n\nIf you're a skilled designer you can probably already tell that we need help pretty badly; our web site is ugly, and we don't even have a logo. Unfortunately, it's about the best we can do without help from someone with a talent for design.\n\nIf you are able (and willing) to help, please [get in touch with us](https://github.com/factopolis/factopolis/labels/design).\n\n#### Front-end Developers\n\nOur site currently uses [Hugo](http://www.gohugo.io) to generate a static web site, but we're interested in supplementing this with a client-side interface, which could provide capabilities beyond what we can do with Hugo.\n\n#### Data Visualization\n\nThere are lots of opportunities to create interesting visualizations\nusing Factopolis's data.  While you are free (and encouraged) to copy\nthe data and publish visualizations yourself, if you create something\nuseful we would certainly be interested in merging it into\nFactopolis's web site.\n\nYou may want to take a look at the [API](/api) page, which should help\nyou discover what data is available.\n\n#### Something Else\n\nDo you have a skillset, or an idea, not covered by something above?\nWe'd love to hear about what it! Just head over to [our chat\nroom](https://gitter.im/factopolis/) or file an issue in [our issue\ntracker](https://github.com/factopolis/factopolis/issues/new).\n","name":"Contributing","id":"/docs/contributing/"}
