Now they then dropped that headline, I never saw this until this morning. They then dropped that headline, and they used another headline without the word wiretap, but they did mean wiretap. Wiretapped data used in inquiry. Then changed after that, they probably didn’t like it. And they changed the title. They took the wiretap word out.","check":[{"checker":"new-york-times","source":"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/23/us/politics/fact-check-trump-misleads-surveillance-wiretapping.html"}],"person":"donald-trump"}],"name":"The New York Times removed the word “wiretapped” from a headline","id":"/claims/nyt-removed-wiretapped-from-headline/"}
